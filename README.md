1.	Download and Ingest the following datasets in a data store of your choice (for more details on downloading the raw dataset, please see instructions at the end of this document).
a.	Dataset 1: 98-400-X2016170 (http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dt-td/Ap-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=110523&PRID=10&PTYPE=109445&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=999&Temporal=2016,2017&THEME=119&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=)
b.	Dataset 2: 98-400-X2016131 (http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dt-td/Ap-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=110270&PRID=10&PTYPE=109445&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=999&Temporal=2016,2017&THEME=119&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=)

2.	Using Dataset 1, using any programming language, calculate and store the following metrics by Canadian regions based on the “Four-Region Model”.
  a.	Proportion of population by “Aboriginal Identity” and “Non-Aboriginal Identity”
  b.	Average Total Income for “Aboriginal Identity” and “Non-Aboriginal Identity”
  c.	Proportion of male vs. female population by “Aboriginal Identity” and “Non-Aboriginal Identity”
  d.	Age group with most number of individuals with “Aboriginal identity” 
•	For definition of “Four-Region Model” see following link (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_Canada)

3.	Bonus 1: Using Dataset 1, create a heat map to visualize the total Aboriginal population by Canadian Geography

4.	Bonus 2: Using Dataset 1, create an interface/API where users can visualize the population and Average Total Income by selecting the following Dimensions:
  a.	Canadian Region based on Four Region model
  b.	“Aboriginal Identity” vs. “Non-Aboriginal Identity”
  c.	Sex
  d.	Age group
  e.	City

5.	Bonus 3: Using any programming language, join Dataset 1 and 2 and create a single dataset that can provide the following metrics by Canadian province 
  a.	Population for “Aboriginal Identity”
  b.	Population for “Non-Aboriginal Identity”
  c.	Total population in 2015 in high income group (after-tax income >= $70,000) where an earner is present in the household
